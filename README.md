# This branch has been retired!
This 'cat' branch for the heterogeneous catalysis version of RMG called,
for a while, RMG-Cat, has been retired.
On 25th April 2019, it was merged into the 'master' branch of the official
RMG [over here](https://github.com/ReactionMechanismGenerator/RMG-Py).
On this date, the two branches are exactly equivalent. Development will continue there.


## Description
This repository contains the Python version of **Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG)**,
a tool for automatically generating chemical reaction
mechanisms for modeling reaction systems including pyrolysis, combustion,
atmospheric science, and more.


RMG-Py is mostly a product of 
- [Professor William H. Green's research group](http://cheme.scripts.mit.edu/green-group/) at the 
[Massachusetts Institute of Technology](http://web.mit.edu/) 
- [Professor Richard H. West's research group](http://www.northeastern.edu/comocheng/) at 
[Northeastern University](http://www.northeastern.edu/). 

This version for heterogeneous catalysis was the result of efforts by
- [C. Franklin Goldsmith](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/cfgoldsm) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/academics/engineering/)
- [Richard H. West](http://www.che.neu.edu/people/west-richard) at 
[Northeastern University](http://www.che.neu.edu). 

The first release of RMG-Cat was described in 
**Automatic Generation of Microkinetic Mechanisms for Heterogeneous Catalysis**
